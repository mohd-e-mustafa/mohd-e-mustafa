### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack software engineer who believes in minimalism and transparency. I look forward
to changing culture and finding a different angle to look at a problem. A self-motivated IT
professional with huge knowledge and proficiency in PHP (Symfony, Laravel), JavaScript (VueJS,
Angular, ReactJS), HTML, CSS, and mobile responsive web development, as well as strong skills
and ability in writing clean and efficient code which is fully tested and has 100% test coverage.
Experience in implementing the best Software Engineering Life Cycles including Agile
Development Methodology, SCRUM, and Extreme Programming to improve software quality and
team's working throughput.
